# PlutoSliderServer.jl

> _**not just sliders!**_

Web server to run just the @bind parts of a [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebook. 

See it in action at [computationalthinking.mit.edu](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/week1/)! Sliders, buttons and camera inputs work _instantly_, without having to wait for a Julia process. Plutoplutopluto

# How it works

Pluto Slider server is a super glue that does a bunch of stuff

1. Opens a Pluto for each of your notebooks and figures out what is going on
2. Saves that into HTML (if you want, with a lot of flavours of that available)
3. Keeps the Pluto session open to get serve sliders (if you want)
4. Serves the HTML files it just created (those that request updated `@binds`, if you want)
5. Watches the files for updates, and keeps the session up to speed (if you want)
6. Asks git** for updates every 5 seconds trigger [5] (if you want)

** That also requires git to be installed in your environment and the `start_dir` to be a repository in which you can `git pull` without password (which means it's either public, or you have the required keys in `~/.ssh/` and your git's provider security page! 

# How to use this package

As PlutoSliderServer embeds so much functionality, it may be confusing to figure out how to approach your setting. That's why we're going to see how to approach some different use cases:

## What PlutoSliderServer provides

- A very rich configuration ‚Äî see the `src/Types.jl` for all available options and see below some sensible options for each use-case
- `run_directory` function - starts from a directory, finds all pluto notebooks and runs them, according to settings
- `github_action` function - (aka `export_directory`) - bundles some presets to be run into a GitHub Action. See MIT course for usage.
- `run_git_directory` function - runs `run_directory` *and* a git-pull loop, also forces watching the directory.

## Usecase: Given a repository, start a PlutoSliderServer to serve static exports with live preview

!Disclaimer!: These are work in progress!! Don't use in production!

1. Create a folder with the `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` for the `PlutoSliderServer` (NOT the notebooks - the notebooks dependencies should be on each notebook!)
```shell
cd <your-repo>
mkdir pluto-slider-server-environment
julia --project=pluto-slider-server-environment
    ]
    add Pluto#main
    add PlutoSliderServer#webhook-v1.5
```

> Note: You can find the resulting Project.toml, Manifest.toml in `pluto-slider-server-environment`. It's there for your convenience, copy it to your repository or recreate it as above.

2. Create a configuration file
(See pluto-slider-server-environment/PlutoDeployment.toml for this example, and üìùüìù)
```toml
[Export]
enabled = true  # Whether to export or not
output_dir = "."  # Where to start looking for notebooks, usually overriden
exclude = []  # Array of notebooks to ignore from export
ignore_cache = []  # Array of notebooks to ignore from cache
# pluto_cdn_root = ""  # If set, the exported files will request external resources from CDN and not your server.
baked_state = true  # include an encoded version of the intial state in the HTML
baked_notebookfile = true  # include an encoded version of the intial state in the HTML
offer_binder = false  # enable the binder button on to-right
disable_ui = true  # Stop showing Pluto UI and make page look like an article
# cache_dir = "cache-folder-should-depend-on-contents"  # Use cache from previous runs (useful in GitHub Actions)
slider_server_url = "http://localhost:2345/"  # URL where your SliderServer is running and accepting `@bind` update requests 
# binder_url = "a-binder-url-that-works-with-your-notebooks"
create_index = true  # Create a automated Pluto notebook that looks like an index page

[SliderServer]
enabled = true  # Keep running the server?
exclude = []  # Which files should be excluded from running the `@bind` parts
port = 2345 
host = "127.0.0.1"
serve_static_export_folder = true  # If false, provide a pluto_cdn_root
start_dir = "."
watch_dir = true  # Whether to watch the filesystem for updates. Uses dyno under the hood 
repository = ""  # Not used
```

3. Run it 
The snippet below assumes you run julia while 
- you have changed into the project directory and
- you have added a `pluto-slider-server-environment` folder with `Project.toml`, `Manifest.toml` and `PlutoDeployment.toml`.

```shell
julia --project="pluto-slider-server-environment" -e "import PlutoSliderServer; PlutoSliderServer.run_directory(\".\", config_toml_path=\"pluto-slider-server-environment/PlutoDeployment.toml\")"
```

If the project directory is also a git repository (public or keys exist in `~/.ssh`) you can alternatively use `run_git_directory`, to pull changes periodically:
```shell
julia --project="pluto-slider-server-environment" -e "import PlutoSliderServer; PlutoSliderServer.run_git_directory(\".\", config_toml_path=\"pluto-slider-server-environment/PlutoDeployment.toml\")"
```

4. Start PlutoSliderServer on restart
For this step, we'll assume a very specific but also common setup:

    1. Ubuntu-based machine with `apt-get`, `git`, `vim` and internet
    2. root access

    
    1. Install Julia (run as root) ```shell
wget https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/linux/x64/1.6/julia-1.6.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar zxvf julia-1.6.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
rm julia-1.6.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
ln -s `pwd`/julia-1.6.1/bin/julia /usr/local/bin/julia
```
    2. get your repository
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/<user>/<repo-with-notebooks>
    ```
    3. Create a service
```shell
sudo cat > /etc/systemd/system/pluto-server.service << __EOF__
[Unit]
After=network.service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/pluto-slider-server.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target

__EOF__
```
    4. Create the startup script
```shell
sudo cat > /usr/local/bin/pluto-slider-server.sh << __EOF__
cd ~/<your-repo>  # Make sure to change folder to your repository
julia --project="pluto-slider-server-environment" -e "import PlutoSliderServer; PlutoSliderServer.run_git_directory(\".\", config_toml_path=\"pluto-slider-server-environment/PlutoDeployment.toml\")"
__EOF__
```

    5. Permissions stuff
```shell
    sudo chmod 744 /usr/local/bin/pluto-slider-server.sh
    sudo chmod 664 /etc/systemd/system/pluto-server.service
```

    6. Enable
```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable disk-space-check.service
```

    7. Adjust settings
    If/When you change your configurations (host, IP, domain name etc), change the files in the repository and restart the server. It should reload 'automatically.

TBA: There will be a simple 1.2.3. checklist to get this running on heroku for your own repository. It is designed to be used in a **containerized** environment (such as heroku, docker, digitalocean apps, ...), in a **push to deploy** setting.

## How to develop this package

If you are not @fonsp and you are interested in developing this, get in touch.

### Step 1 (only once)

Clone this repo to say `~/PlutoSliderServer.jl/`.

Clone Pluto.jl to say `~/Pluto.jl/` and checkout the `slider-server-client-1` branch. This is a fork of the `binder-static-to-live-1` branch, have a look at the difference between those two, not between ` slider-server-client-1`` and  `master`.

Create a new VS Code session and add both folders. You are interested in these files:

-   `Pluto.jl/frontend/components/Editor.js` search for `use_slider_server`
-   `Pluto.jl/frontend/common/PlutoHash.js`
-   `PlutoSliderServer.jl/src/PlutoSliderServer.jl`
-   `PlutoSliderServer.jl/src/MoreAnalysis.jl`
-   `PlutoSliderServer.jl/test/runtestserver.jl`

(FYI since these files _use_ Pluto, you can't develop them inside Pluto.)

### Step 2 (only once)

```julia
julia> ]
pkg> dev ~/PlutoSliderServer.jl
pkg> dev ~/Pluto.jl
```

### Step 3 (every time)

You can run the bind server like so:

```
bash> cd PlutoSliderServer.jl
bash> julia --project test/runtestserver.jl
```

Edit the `runtestserver.jl` file to suit your needs.

The bind server will start running on port 2345. It can happen that HTTP.jl does a goof and the port becomes unavaible until you reboot. Edit `runtestserver.jl` to change the port.

### Step 4 -- easy version (every time)

If you run the Slider server using the runtestserver.jl, it will also run a static HTTP server for the exported files on the same port. E.g. the export for `test/dir1/a.jl` will be available at `localhost:2345/test/dir1/a.html`.

Go to `localhost:2345/test/dir1/a.html`.

Pluto's assets are also being server over this server, you can edit them and refresh.


### Step 4 -- hard version (every time)

You can now open the editor in 'serverless' mode, by going to `http://localhost:1234/editor.html`. This should be stuck at "loading", because it has no backend connection and no statedump.

You need to provide the editor with a notebook file and a notebook statedump, which need to be accessible via URLs, **with CORS enabled**. 

If you run the Slider server using the runtestserver.jl, it will also run a static HTTP server for the exported files on the same port. E.g. the files for `test/dir1/a.jl` will be available at `localhost:2345/test/dir1/a.jl`, `localhost:2345/test/dir1/a.jlstate`.


##### Using the statefile

You need to URL-encode the URLs to the statefile and the julia file. (Open node and call `encodeURIComponent`.) Use them in the URL query to tell Pluto where to find the files:

For example, I have:
- Pluto (as CDN) at: `http://localhost:1234/editor.html`
- notebook file at: `https://mkhj.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/slider-server-tests/onedefinesanother.jl`
- notebook state dump at: `https://mkhj.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/slider-server-tests/onedefinesanother.jlstate`
- bind server at: `http://localhost:3456/`

This becomes:

> [http://localhost:1234/editor.html?statefile=https%3A%2F%2Fmkhj.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com%2Fslider-server-tests%2Fonedefinesanother.jlstate&notebookfile=https%3A%2F%2Fmkhj.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com%2Fslider-server-tests%2Fonedefinesanother.jl&disable_ui=yes&slider_server_url=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3345%2F](http://localhost:1234/editor.html?statefile=https%3A%2F%2Fmkhj.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com%2Fslider-server-tests%2Fonedefinesanother.jlstate&notebookfile=https%3A%2F%2Fmkhj.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com%2Fslider-server-tests%2Fonedefinesanother.jl&disable_ui=yes&slider_server_url=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3345%2F)

with whitespace:

```
http://localhost:1234/editor.html?
    statefile=
        https%3A%2F%2Fmkhj.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com%2Fslider-server-tests%2Fonedefinesanother.jlstate
    &notebookfile=
        https%3A%2F%2Fmkhj.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com%2Fslider-server-tests%2Fonedefinesanother.jl
    &disable_ui=
        yes
    &slider_server_url=
        http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3345%2F
```
